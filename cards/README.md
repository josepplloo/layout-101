My `cards` designe ðŸ¦‘
====================

This proyect challenge you to introduce in 3 diferent ways to deal whit a card `HTML` escenario. First of all, you can do whit cordenades but, given that  solution, the proyect will be static and not easy to mantain or scale. Therefore, try to solve using `flex` & `grid` `CSS` properties on the containers.


You can see the the original in [Jen Simmons ](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/01-005.html), the `:checked` CSS pseudo-class selector helps to avoid JavaScript in this scenario. I think in `grid` for do multidimencional components, build photo galeries or why not a table game.
